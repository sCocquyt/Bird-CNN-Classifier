# Bird CNN Classifier
I wrote this CNN to classify bird species from input images, similar to the software offered by [Seek by iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app). The CNN is built in Google Colab and implemented in an [Anvil App](https://anvil.works/). A downside is that the Google Colab must be running to implement the web app; I'm currently working on a solution to this. I hope to expand this project to a wider variety of species, potentially including plants and fungi.
